/*
Projectile - A projectile is any kind of non-static and non-permanent physical object 
which follows a simple trajectory consisting of only two points, origin and end.

The lifecycle of a projectile:

* Gets created at an origin
* Follows a trajectory towards it's target
* Reaches or does not reach it's target
* Gets destroyed

The appearance of a projectile in case of a spell is handled by the SpellEffect object which resides inside the projectile object.

Example of a regular projectile: 
    A spell or an arrow shoot by the player or by a game object towards an object, npc or area.

The appearance, physical properties, description is described by a special class dedicated to hold data.

Example:
    The Fireball object describes the Fireball spell with all it's properties regarding description, damage, appearance etc.

* Note as mentioning above SpellEffect handles the appearance but it doesn't describe it. 
  SpellEffect's only responsibility is to render the appearance not to describe it.
